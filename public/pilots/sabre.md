An adept swordfighter, Hatice Bywater hails from a planet outside Union space, renowned within its system for their dueling culture. Their life growing up was steeped in ancient tradition, martial arts were more than a way of life, they were an honor to uphold and a way to preserve history. Trained by their grandfather, a master swordsman and historian, Hatice grew up learning the philosophy of the blade. For them, swordsmanship was more than combat, it was a meditative art, a way to balance both body and mind.

By the age of 16, Hatice was recognized as a prodigy, winning regional tournaments with his flawless technique and uncanny instincts. However, this skill came with a burden, when his home came under attack by another house, his sword became a tool for survival. The victory was hollow, his grandfather killed in the attack, leaving Hatice with a sharpened sense of duty but biterness toward conflict.

Determined to honor his grandfather's legacy but with nothing but his blade, Hatice became a wandering mercenary, offering his skills to those who couldn't protect themselves. When an MSMC carrier came into the system he was staying in, Hatice signed up with them to offer his services to more people, eventually earning a pilot's license through them.
