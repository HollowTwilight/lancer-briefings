Born to the illustrious Mcaree family, these rulers of a small planet on the Atlas-Line terraformed a small region and became known for their advanced bioengineering research for the Smith-Shimano Corportation. Her family's legacy spanned multiple generations, shaping the territory into one that could become a haven for culture and prospertity in this region of wild space. Marguerite was destined for a life of privilege, but it was her mother, Lady Marianna Mcaree, that instilled in her the belief that her nobility stemmed not from her status but her service to the people. "The higher we stand, the greater our responsibility to those below.", she often told her daughter. Because of this, Marguerite frequently associated with other groups, learning of their struggles and how to earn their admiration as a capable leader.

When there was a planetary training program for the defense forces, Marguerite volunteered to undertake the training alongside the other soldiers. "If I am to lead them, I must fight with them."

Though her family initially disagreed, Marguerite chose to undergo the neural linking process to become a pilot. The training was unlike anything Marguerite had been used to before, the control systems required both physical prowess and mental resilience to interface properly. Her background gave her an edge, her finely tuned genetics allowing her to adapt more easily to the demanding efforts to work the mech.

It was when she was training off-world that she would learn about the destruction of her homeland. Enemies had attacked the facilities while the defense forces were divided, causing damage to the main reactor and causing a meltdown, destroying the region and all structures nearby.

The mental toll of this, grappled with the harsh realities she would now have to face, pushed Marguerite to her limits. She struggled to reconcile the loss of her noble position with her current role as a soldier. "What use is training to defend, when there's nothing left to protect?" Despite her doubts, she continued her training, showcasing a strategic mind and strong leadership skills once she put her mind to it.

Over time, she would come to be recruited by the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company. Their connections and resources were a tempting offer to someone left with none, and so the deal was struck.

**TACTICS**

The Fire Support is a force multiplier and adaptable battlefield commander that can turn the tide of a battle from the backline.

The Fire Support’s most important feature is the Leadership talent, which lets you grant Accuracy to teammates, and should be used judiciously to ensure clutch shots and narrow escapes fall in your favor. 

The Heavy Gunner talent can lock down a dangerous enemy with the extremely powerful Heavy Machine Gun, and the dual Threat 3 Pistols punish enemies who get too close. 

With an expanded Limited capacity, you’re able to deploy additional Turret Drones and Smoke Charges to fortify a control zone or secure a breach into enemy territory.

The Fire Support is especially useful to allied sniper and artillery mechs thanks to Spotter, which improves Lock Ons when they’re consumed adjacent to you, and the Jericho Deployable Cover can transform a sniper nest from exposed to impregnable.
