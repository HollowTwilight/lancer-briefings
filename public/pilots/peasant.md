On Gody's homeworld, renowned for its agricultural exports, you could see sprawling plains as far as the eye could see. The Volo family was modest but vital, producing nutrient-rich crops for the planet that helped sustain it's meager population. From an early age, Gody learned the value for hard work, spending long days operating massive automated harvesters, reparing aging machinery, and tending to the land. His father often said, "The land gives what you put into it, treat it with respect and it'll feed you for a lifetime."

Despite the backbreaking labor, Gody loved the simplicity of farm life. He was a natural with machines, often modifying equipment to make work easier. By his late teens, he had become the farm's unofficial mechanic, able to fix anything from irrigation drones to industrial tractors.

But beneath the tranquil skies, Gody's planet was a prime target for corporate exploitation. One fateful harvest season, pirates attacked hoping to raid and take over the poorly defended planet. Massive machines of war descended onto their farmlands, turning their fields of crops into battlegrounds. When the planetary defense forces were overwhelmed, Gody tried to flee with his family, however they were ambushed. Desperate to protect his loved ones, Gody hotwired an abandoned construction mech that was nearby. Though run-down and much more crude than military-grade mechs, Gody fought valiantly, using the hydralic claws and reinforced plating to defend and fight back.

The victory was short-lived. Though Gody survived, his family didn't. As he held their bodies in his arms, their home was reduced to ash in the distance, the orange glow of flames beneath a pillar of smoke. While most would be left broken, Gody swore to fight back, vowing to payback the devestation he had endured. He would sign up with the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company as soon as they came for clean-up operations, earning their pilot's license with them.
