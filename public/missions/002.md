# Mission // #002
## Operation: Shattered Mirrors

Pirate sightings place the colony at its maximum security level and they ask the squad to be on high alert. They are asked to stay around the colony while San Fengri scouts try to predict the movements of the Fengri raiders.
Before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action.

# Goals
- Defend San Fengri and protect San Fengri’s reactor.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, San Fengri’s reactors will be destroyed, forcing the colony to use backup power, demolishing its defenses and its ability to function.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
