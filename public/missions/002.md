# Mission // #002
## Operation: Broken Mirror
//EMERGENCY OPERATION//

Scouts have identified the leader of the Fengrian raiders at a fortified position outside the city. Allied forces are unable to spare the manpower for a task force able to complete this mission and so they've asked us. Pierce through enemy's defenses and quickly take out their leader, then extract.

Good hunting.

# Goals
- Break into enemy's fortified position and take out their leader.
- Extract before reinforcements arrive and overwhelm the squad.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, allied mechs will be taken, and pilots will have to eject then exfil on foot to avoid capture.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
