# Mission // #002-A
## Operation: Broken Mirror
//EMERGENCY OPERATION//

Fengrian raiders sighted near the colony place it at the maximum security level. They request that the squad stationed be on high alert. They ask that you stay around the colony while San Fengri scouts try to predict the movements of the Fengrian raiders to coordinate with local air and ground forces.

But before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action. A quick decision must be made on where to send our forces:

Control of the planetary spaceport has been lost to a hostile unit. Without the telemetry data from its orbital uplink, allies forces will be unable to coordinate and be limited in tactical assistance. Break the enemy's hold and retake the spaceport in one piece.

# Goals
- Retake Fengri's only planetary spaceport.
- Keep the orbital uplink in one piece.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, allied defense forces will be significantly delayed. Enemy's tactical efficiency will increase.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
