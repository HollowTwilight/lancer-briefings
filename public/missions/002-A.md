# Mission // #002
## Operation: Shattered Mirrors
//EMERGENCY OPERATION//

Fengrian raiders sighted near the planetary spaceport put the colony at its maximum security level. They request that the squad stationed be on high alert. They ask that you stay around the colony while San Fengri scouts try to predict the movements of the Fengri raiders for local air support to mobilize.

Before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action.

# Goals
- Defend San Fengri and buy time for San Fengri scouts to complete their mission.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, San Fengriâ€™s reactors will be destroyed and its spaceport taken over, forcing the colony to use backup power, demolishing its defenses and its ability to function.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
