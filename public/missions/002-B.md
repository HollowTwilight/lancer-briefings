# Mission // #002-B
## Operation: Broken Mirror
//EMERGENCY OPERATION//

Fengrian raiders sighted near the colony put it at maximum security level. They request that the squad stationed be on high alert. They ask that you stay around the colony while San Fengri scouts try to predict the movements of the Fengrian raiders to coordinate with local air and ground forces.

But before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action. A quick decision must be made on where to send our forces:

Enemy forces have breached the defensive perimeter of the city and are making slow but steady progress towards the colony's reactor controls. Intercept their route ahead of them, and set up a holdout position to fend off the enemy until friendly reinforcements can reach the city to assist in defense.

# Goals
- Defend San Fengri's reactor controls.
- Set up and defend an advance position from enemy advance.
- Buy enough time for reinforcements to arrive.

# Stakes
- If the operation is failed, San Fengriâ€™s reactors will be lost, forcing the colony to rely on backup power, demolishing its defenses and its ability to function significantly.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
